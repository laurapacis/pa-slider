## About

The project is an example of a slider element with two sub-sliders: one image slider and one text slider.

## Stack

Built with React.js and styled with CSS. Deployed with Vercel.

## Development time

approx. 2 days of work.

## Aspects I focused:

#### Interaction

Although The slides behave in `autoPlay`, the user can navigate through the slides by clicking on both right and left sides of the element or by selecting a specific square of the indicator element below the slider element, which represents an overview of all the slides.

#### Responsiveness

The project is tested in:

- iPhone XS / iOS 14.4.2 / Chrome
- iPhone 11 / iOS 14.4 / Safari
- iPad Air / iOS 12.4.9 / Chrome
- Samsung Galaxy S8 / Android 9 / Chrome, DuckDuckGo
- Chrome Desktop Browser / Version 90.0.4430.93
- Firefox Desktop Browser / Version 88.0 (64-bit)

#### Design

I decided to go for a professional and formal style, choosing a topic that fascinates and inspires me: [computational design in parametric architecture](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/parametric-design-architecture-shaping-industry/).

## My approach

I focused on punctual delivery and [quality for the images over speed of the website](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpa-slider.vercel.app%2F&tab=mobile).

## Improvements

With a longer deadline I would have developed:

- Responsiveness for mobile landscape mode.
- Responsiveness in more browsers and devices.
- Better design of the navigation arrows on desktop view.
- Swipe navigation of slides triggered by touch on mobile.

## Personal level of satisfaction

7/10

## Final thoughts

This was an exciting project where I learned to make something that I see daily on the Internet, sliders! Therefore it was exciting and interesting. I also improved my management skills and discovered that I enjoy working under pressure since it allows me to hyperfocus and pushes myself out of the limits of my comfort zone.
